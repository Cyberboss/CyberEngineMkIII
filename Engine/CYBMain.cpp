//The engine has several components it needs to start before even thinking about the initial unit

/*
	. Memory Pools: It needs 2 to start
		The main engine heap
		The logger heap
	. Activate the logger
	. Create the core and have it parse the command line. Wrap it with error processing
		. Lock the engine heap and call into the unit to retrieve the function pointers
		. Activate Steam DRM
		. Lock the mutex if necessary
		. Start the ThreadPool
		. Set the engine language
		. Activate the console
		. Replace our icon with the unit's
